Design-system layout patterns (ConstructUISkill_DesignSystem.md §1) -- the one
genuinely new orchestration layer this project builds: no header/footer/menu-
widget-building code existed before this phase. Starts with ONE pattern end-to-end
(the footer half of Header-Content-Footer, "the default, safest... fallback when no
other pattern is a clearly better fit") -- the other four patterns and
build_header_widget follow the same shape once this one is proven, same
incremental precedent as palette.py's "one verified type at a time."

      doesn't have, same fallback reasoning as the 6-7 item portrait case.
