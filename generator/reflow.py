    Tier 1 (move): if the group's bounding-box span already fits target_dim, shift
    everyone by one constant offset -- relative gaps are preserved exactly.
    Tier 2 (compact): otherwise, shrink internal gaps (order-preserving) toward a
    min_gap floor, linearly interpolated by how much reduction is still needed.
    Tier 3 (scale): if gaps are already at the floor and it's still not enough, scale
    every item's size by one shared factor (reserving room for the mandatory min_gap
    gaps first) and repack at exactly min_gap.

    See the spec's "Why this still can't introduce new overlaps" for the proof this
    relies on: order is never changed, and no gap is ever allowed to go negative.

    # CORRECTED 2026-09-09, twice (task review caught two real bugs; the first fix
    # introduced a smaller residual of the same symptom, caught by the fix's own
    # scoped re-review). Bug 1: the original `max_possible_reduction = total_gap -
    # (n-1)*min_gap` sums ALL gaps uniformly, including any gap already below min_gap
    # (or negative, i.e. overlapping input) -- those gaps must EXPAND to reach the
    # floor, not contribute reduction, so the old formula could credit negative
    # "slack" and under-reduce the span, silently returning a layout wider than
    # target_dim. Fixed by splitting each gap into reducible slack (above the floor)
    # vs. mandatory deficit (below the floor) and budgeting needed_reduction against
    # slack alone, plus deficit -- this part of the fix is unchanged from the first
    # correction. Bug 2 (found in the first fix's own re-review): rounding each
    # position INCREMENTALLY (off the previous ROUNDED position) still let up to
    # ~0.5px of rounding error compound across many gaps, occasionally pushing the
    # final span a few px over target_dim even though every individual gap still met
    # the 4px floor. Fixed the same way Tier 3 fixes its own analogous rounding
    # problem: floor (never round) each gap to an integer before accumulating
    # positions. A float gap is already >= min_gap by construction (the `max(min_gap,
    # ...)` above), and min_gap is an integer, so floor(gap) >= min_gap always --
    # flooring can only ever shrink the accumulated span relative to the exact
